# Water_Changer.py
This measures how much energy is needed to change the temperature and phase of water
To use this, you will need to input numeric values in the variables "mass", "starting_temperature", and "ending_temperature". 
The mass is measured in grams. All temperatures should be in Celsius.
The output of the program is in Joules.
Please tell me if there are any logical or mathematic errors in the program.
